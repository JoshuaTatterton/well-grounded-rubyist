the STANDARD LIBRARY is the extensions which come with ruby as standard. There are a lot of them and are for a wide veriety of purposes.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using extensions and libraries need the "require" method and knowing its relation to "load" is also needed.
Think of YAML from learn to program 12 i think of chris pine Learn to Program V2.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using the following will display the folders that LOAD and REQUIRE will search for files called upon

	ruby -e "puts $:"

The global variable $: is the paths ruby searches, the -e just tells ruby to run the next part as ruby code instead of looking for a file.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LOAD

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

to simply load a file from the same directory the code running it is in uses the following

	load "x"

This will load file "x" in the current directory

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using the following will allow different thing to happen

	load "../x"

As seen above you can change directory for file "x" using the same commands as you would use in the command line e.g use ../.. to go up 2 directories, use ~/ to go back to current user documents, or the full pwd of file "x" for more permenant file calls.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

REQUIRE

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Require differs from Load because where load uses the file once whereas require will keep the file on hand. You activate it using the following

	require "./x"

You need the ./ for this as the current directory was removed from the LOAD_PATH for require in version 1.9 apparently. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Or the following could be used instead to not need the file location as long as it is in the current directory.

	require_relative "x"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The file type ".rb" is not needed in require

Full directory locations can be used in the same way as LOAD.
