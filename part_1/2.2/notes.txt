Beware using floats because they are stored differently you could end up with the following example

	puts 0.5 - 0.4 - 0.1
	-2.77555756156289e-17		<- NOT ZERO as it should be

This is bacause the are stored/calculated in binary for "complete accuracy", just look for rounding options if this happens. See bellow
	
	example = 2.501
	puts "Price: £#{"%.2f." % example}"

Will give the following more desirable output to 2 decimal places

	Price: £2.50

You already know but use #{example} to insert variables into puts/print

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When creating a method which is going to return either truth of false is is customary to end it with "?", to show is this going to happen.

Boolean

Boolean is the language of being true or false, in some cases (not in ruby) it is represented as 1's and 0's of binary if you want to think of it that way.

False

The only "Falsey" objects in ruby are "false" and "nil".

Truthy

All other objects/values are treated as "truthy", i.e are true.
